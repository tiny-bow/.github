Ribbon is two sibling projects, inspired by a history in game development, and a deep love for high performance systems and modding.

* a programming language striking a new balance between high level programmer experience and low level
systems access, by adapting influences from the latest in academia and practical development

* a real time software engine, utilizing the insights of Ribbon to enable new approaches to extensibility and performance


Focal points of the design include:
+ Performance-friendly effect handlers
+ Composable allocation strategies
+ Embedding into other applications
+ Strong static types with full inference
+ Polymorphism for structural data and procedures
+ Rich api information through the use of marker types
+ Deep extensibility in the style of
[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) and
[Terra](https://terralang.org/)
